# SSL Certificate Files - DO NOT COMMIT
#
# Private keys and certificates should never be committed to version control.
# These files contain sensitive cryptographic material that must be kept secure.
#
# For Development:
#   - Generate certificates using: bash generate-cert.sh
#   - Self-signed certificates are acceptable (will trigger browser warnings)
#
# For Production:
#   - Use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
#   - Options: Let's Encrypt (free), DigiCert, Comodo, AWS ACM, GCP Certificate Manager
#   - Store certificates securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.)
#   - Never commit production certificates to version control

# Private Keys (CRITICAL - NEVER COMMIT)
*.pem
*.key
*.crt
*.cert
*.p12

# Certificate Signing Requests
